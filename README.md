# Machine Learning–Based Purchase Order Recommendation
This project analyzes how machine learning models generate Purchase Order (PO) recommendations for a motorcycle spare parts warehouse using historical sales data and current inventory levels.
The main focus is not on performance optimization, but on understanding and interpreting model behavior in a real-world inventory decision-making context.

## Project Motivation
Purchase Order decisions in many inventory systems are still driven by rule-based logic, such as moving averages of historical sales. While simple and interpretable, these methods often fail to capture demand variability across fast-moving and slow-moving spare parts.

This project explores how machine learning models learn from the same data and how their recommendations differ from traditional rule-based approaches.
This project investigates how different machine learning models learn from sales and stock data, and how their recommendations differ from traditional rule-based methods.

## Objectives
- Understand how machine learning models map sales and inventory features to PO recommendations
- Compare rule-based baseline, Linear Regression, and Random Forest approaches
- Analyze and interpret model behavior using coefficients and feature importance
- Highlight strengths and limitations of each approach in an operational warehouse context

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of 50 motorcycle spare parts, where each row represents one item with the following features:

## Methodology
1. Rule-Based Baseline

- Uses a 3-month moving average of historical sales

2. Machine Learning Models

- Linear Regression
  - High interpretability via coefficients
  - Captures linear relationships

- Random Forest Regressor
  - Captures non-linear relationships and feature interactions
  - Interpreted using feature importance

The target variable for both models is the baseline PO quantity, used as a proxy label to study how models replicate decision logic.

## Rule-Based Baseline (Moving Average)
A rule-based baseline is used as a reference for PO recommendations, calculated using the average sales of the last three months minus current stock.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Stock vs Average Sales

This scatter plot illustrates the relationship between current inventory and historical demand, highlighting potential overstock and understock conditions.

## Machine Learning Models
### Linear Regression
Linear Regression is used for its simplicity and high interpretability.

The coefficients indicate the direction and magnitude of each feature’s influence on PO recommendations.

### Random Forest Regressor
Random Forest is applied to capture non-linear relationships and feature interactions.

Feature importance highlights which variables contribute most to the model’s decision-making process.

## Model Evaluation
### MAE Comparison

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is used to compare how closely each model replicates the baseline PO recommendations.

## Recommendation Results Comparison
### PO Output Comparison

This table compares PO recommendations generated by:

- Rule-based baseline (po_baseline_qty)
- Linear Regression (po_lr_qty)
- Random Forest (po_rf_qty)

## Experiments & Evaluation
- Train-test split: time-based (to avoid data leakage)
- Evaluation metric: Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Focus on behavioral comparison, not model optimization

## Key Findings
- Linear Regression produces more stable and interpretable recommendations
- Random Forest achieves lower MAE and is more adaptive to demand variability
- Recent sales data has the strongest influence on PO recommendations
- Stock level consistently acts as a limiting factor
- Fast-moving classification affects Linear Regression more strongly than Random Forest

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## Project Scope & Limitations
- Limited dataset size and time horizon
- External factors (promotions, seasonality, supplier lead time) are not considered
- Models are used for analysis and understanding, not direct deployment

## Future Work
- Extend dataset with longer time periods and seasonal effects
- Incorporate external signals (promotions, events, vehicle types)
- Explore advanced models (Gradient Boosting, Time Series, Deep Learning)
- Compare decision quality beyond baseline replication

## Related Work
This project is aligned with academic studies on:

- Inventory management
- Demand forecasting
- Interpretable machine learning
- Decision support systems
